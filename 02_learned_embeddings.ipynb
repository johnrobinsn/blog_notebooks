    "## 1. The Simplest Approach: Just Learn It\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of designing a clever mathematical function to encode position, learned positional embeddings ask: **Why not let the model learn the best way to represent each position?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Key Clarification: What's Given vs. What's Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common point of confusion, so let's be precise:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Component | Status | Explanation |\n",
    "|-----------|--------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Position index** (0, 1, 2, ...) | **Explicitly provided** | The model is *told* \"this token is at position 5\" — it doesn't discover this from context |\n",
    "| **Embedding vector** for each position | **Learned via backpropagation** | The model learns *what values* best represent \"position 5\" |\n",
    "\n",
    "**The position index IS the ground truth signal.** When we process a sequence, we don't ask the model to figure out which position each token occupies — we explicitly look up row 0 for position 0, row 5 for position 5, etc. This mapping is hardwired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's learned is HOW to represent each position** — the actual d-dimensional vector of floats that gets added to the token embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔑 **Analogy:** Think of a classroom seating chart. The seat numbers (positions 0, 1, 2...) are fixed and labeled on each desk. What's \"learned\" over time is the personality/reputation associated with each seat (\"the front row is for eager students\"). The model learns useful representations, but it's never confused about *which seat is which*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a lookup table (matrix) with one row per position, randomly initialized\n",
    "2. During training, use the **known position index** to look up the corresponding row\n",
    "3. Backpropagation updates the embedding values to minimize loss\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{output}_i = \\text{token\\_embedding}_i + \\text{position\\_embedding}[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `position_embedding[i]` means: \"look up row $i$ in the embedding table\" — the index $i$ is known, the values in that row are learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Maximum sequence length $L$\n",
    "- Embedding dimension $d$\n",
    "\n",
    "The position embedding matrix $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ is initialized randomly and optimized during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P = \\begin{bmatrix} p_0 \\\\ p_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ p_{L-1} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a token at position $i$:\n",
    "$$e_i^{\\text{final}} = e_i^{\\text{token}} + p_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Is NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "To further clarify, learned positional embeddings are **not**:\n",
    "- Learning to infer position from surrounding context\n",
    "- Discovering position through attention patterns\n",
    "- Figuring out \"where am I?\" from the content\n",
    "\n",
    "Those would be fascinating (and much harder!) problems. Instead, this is simply: \"Given that I know this token is at position $i$, what's the best vector to represent that position?\""

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Research has shown that:\n",
    "- **Nearby positions develop similar embeddings** — the model learns that position 5 should be more similar to position 6 than to position 100\n",
    "- **Smooth gradients emerge** — embeddings change gradually across positions rather than randomly\n",
    "- **Task-specific patterns appear** — unlike fixed sinusoidal PE, learned embeddings can adapt to the specific positional patterns useful for the training task\n",
